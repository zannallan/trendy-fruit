Watermelon
Watermelons are a sweet, popular fruit of summer, usually consumed fresh in slices. The rind of the fruit is mid- to dark green and usually mottled or striped, and the flesh can be red or pink (most commonly), orange, yellow, green or white.

Starfruit
The fruit has distinctive ridges running down its sides (usually five but can sometimes vary); when cut in cross-section, it resembles a star, hence its name. The entire fruit is edible and is usually eaten out of hand.

Persimmon
The non-astringent persimmon is squat like a tomato and is most commonly sold as <i>fuyu</i>. The ripe fruit of the cultivated strains range from glossy light yellow-orange to dark red-orange depending on the species and variety.
